#PM4W
The PM4W project aims to improve water and sanitation in rural parts of Uganda by enabling access to information by various stakeholders and players in the Water and Sanitation sector. Using mobile phones baseline and inspection information is collected about each water point using the Ministry of Water and Environment guidelines and standards.

PM4W is a research tool to support rural communities in the management of their water supplies under the Community based (water) management model. This research seeks to not only empower communities to participate in the design and development of ICT tools that meet their needs but also to show how technology design approaches can contribute to sustainability of community-based ICT interventions.

PM4W is limited to a few users. However the project is open source and is provided without any warranty or user support. The project is Licenced under MIT Licence. It might contain some bugs, some features might not be developed fully and others are missing so pulls and merges are welcome.

The project can be found online here
